### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data specialist at [Contabilizei](https://www.contabilizei.com.br), an accounting startup in Brazil. I like to design data products and solutions, and I love to understand things through data. Prior to Contabilizei, I worked at [Yara](https://www.yara.com), [RBS](https://www.gruporbs.com.br/) and [Getnet](https://site.getnet.com.br), always with a data driven mind.
